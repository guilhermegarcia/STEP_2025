# NOTE: Load q-1 and danish-1

# NOTE: Part 1: Data cleaning + key tidyverse functions (review)
# mutate, filter, select, if_else, summarize, rename, arrange, etc.
# Real scenario: you have some chaotic data to analyse
# First, you need to "clean" it; only then can you truly work with it
# So before discussing figures, we need to make sure we know how
# to prepare the data, i.e., how to clean it.


# QUESTION: Does the file follow the tidy format? Is it long or wide?
# NOTE: First step: print names of cols


# NOTE: Part 1.1: Practice

# QUESTION:
# 1. What are some obvious figures for these data?
# 2. Can you combine multiple variables in the same figure? What variables would you combine?
# 3. What relationships do you observe between the variables plotted?


# NOTE: Part 2: Aesthetics
# Let's use both our survey data and danish-1.csv here.

# NOTE: Percentages, colours, font, labels, themes


# QUESTION: Go back to the Danish data set
# and create a figure with customized aesthetics.
# You decide what aspects of the figure you'd like to alter.


# NOTE: Part 3: Ordinal data -> back to our survey
# Plotting ordinal data can be tricky; here's why
