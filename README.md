# The fundamentals of data visualization in R

3-day workshop at the CCP Spring Training in Experimental Psycholinguistics, University of Alberta, 2025.

This workshop focuses on data visualization using R and versatile packages such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and others. Over three days, participants will learn to create clear, publication-ready visualizations tailored to linguistic and psycholinguistic data. Day 1 introduces the principles of effective visual communication, the structure of `ggplot2`, and essential `geoms` for visualizing experimental results. Day 2 emphasizes data transformation using `dplyr`, customization using scales, grids, as well as the functional use of aesthetics to showcase group and condition effects. Day 3 explores specialized techniques for visualizing individual variation, statistical model estimates, and creating interactive plots to analyze complex experimental outcomes. The workshop includes several practical exercises.
